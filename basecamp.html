    <strong>This is <a href="http://medium.com/&#64;aliservetdonmez">Ali</a>.</strong> I am the guy who created <a href="http://workinprogress.show">Work in Progress Show website</a> for <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried">Jason</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/natekontny">Nate</a>. As soon as I heard you were looking for interns in 2016, I decided to show you how much I care about your work through this page.

    Please watch <strong>super short</strong> introduction video that I recorded <em>for you</em> and check out the product concept website that I am presenting in the video at <a href="http://talktomycustomers.com">http://talktomycustomers.com</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>I am dangerous enough (for sth) with coding</li>
        <li>I do what I do with passion — that is programming</li>
        <li>I constantly seek to learn new things and adapt my skills as I evolve</li>
        <li>I am a very good written communicator — I pick my words carefully for careful readers to understand my thoughts as clear as possible</li>
        <li>I am good at creating (and destroying) new ideas and love to work them become real products or features</li>
        <li>I like watching movie trailers</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="title">I <strong>must</strong> work with you because&hellip;</h1>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Remote work (also the book)</li>
        <li>Basecamp's company culture for employees (Jason's talks)</li>
        <li>I have to work with people who are possibly much better than I am in what they do so I can learn from them</li>
